This course is designed for people (or bunnies) with some coding experience who want to learn how to apply deep learning and machine learning to practical problems.<br /><br />Deep learning can do all kinds of amazing things. For instance, all illustrations throughout this website are made with deep learning, using [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/).

## Welcome!

In this course we will cover topics such as how to:

![](images/imagine.png)

- Build and train deep learning models for computer vision, natural language processing, tabular analysis, and collaborative filtering problems
- Create random forests and regression models
- Deploy models
- Use PyTorch, the world’s fastest growing deep learning software, plus popular libraries like fastai and Hugging Face

To get started, [click here]() for lesson 1. There are 7 lessons, and each lesson is around 90 minutes long. The course is based on our [popular book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527), which is [freely available](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) online.

You don’t need any special hardware or software — we’ll show you how to use free resources for both building and deploying models. You don’t need any university math either — we’ll teach you the calculus and linear algebra you need during the course.

## Real results

By the end of the second lesson, you will have built and deployed your own deep learning model on data you collect. Many students post their course projects to our forum; you can view them here. For instance, if there’s an unknown dinosaur in your backyard, maybe you need this [dinosaur classifier](https://notebooksg.jarvislabs.ai/U7mQvWgvra53-YvTogLgJCfNzgJxRJv238Go2bHoAmHBqQFHoOL1ZFeKDG8gYmnO/)!

Alumni of our course have gone on to jobs at organizations like Google Brain, OpenAI, and Tesla, published research at top conferences such as [NeurIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_Neural_Information_Processing_Systems), and created startups using skills they learned here. Petro Cuenca, lead developer of the widely-acclaimed [Camera+](https://camera.plus/) app, after completing the course went on to add deep learning features to his product, which was then [featured by Apple](https://twitter.com/pcuenq/status/1540121042596904963) for its “machine learning magic”.
