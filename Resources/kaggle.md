TODO

[Paperspace Gradient](https://gradient.run/notebooks) because we've found they work really well for this course, and have good free options. We also will do some parts of the course on your own laptop. (If you don't have a Paperspace account yet, sign up with [this link](https://console.paperspace.com/signup?R=lg6rnx) to get $10 credit -- and we get a credit too.)
